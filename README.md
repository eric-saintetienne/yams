# Yam's

This repo contains the output files for the `npm run build` command of an implementation in ReactJS of the Yam's game (a Yahtzee variant played in France).

It's usable as it is, but not extendable I'm afraid as only compiled and minified files are present, not the source files although with some react specific browser plugins you could see the components structure to some extent.

It's in French with built-in rules and hardcoded player names, but it's perfectly playable. Don't ask for the rules, they're easy to figure out :)

The game can be accessed through Github Pages at https://eric-saintetienne.github.io/yams
